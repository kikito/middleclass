h1. MiddleClass specs

These specs have been implemented using "telescope":http://github.com/norman/telescope

They are a series of tests that verify that the current implementation of MiddleClass works as expected. It is recommended to run them after modifying MiddleClass.

h2. Installation dependencies for the specs

First step is installing telescope. The easiest way in ubuntu is installing luarocks and then telescope itself:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install lua luarocks
sudo luarocks build telescope --from=http://luarocks.luaforge.net/rocks-cvs/
</pre>

The first command might ask about installing some dependencies; answer (y)es to that.

h2. Test execution

Open a console and change to the middleclass top-directory:

<pre>
cd middleclass
</pre>

Then execute @specs/run.lua@. It should be configured to start the testing automatically.
<pre>
specs/run.lua
</pre>

If everything has been set up properly, you should see lost of testing being done, and, hopefully, passing.
